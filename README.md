**Project Requirements:**

1. **Page Structure:**
    - At least three distinct pages. Examples could be "Home," "Schedule," "Fun Facts," or any other thematic pages you believe represent you.
  
2. **Bootstrap Integration:**
    - Your website must utilize Bootstrap for layout and styling.
    - Incorporate various Bootstrap components to make your site intuitive and visually appealing.

3. **Navigation Bar (Navbar):**
    - A consistent Navbar should appear at the top of each page.
    - The Navbar must indicate which page (or section) the user is currently viewing.

4. **Bootstrap Grid System:**
    - Your content should be organized using the Bootstrap grid system to ensure a clean layout on all devices.
    - The design should reflect an understanding of grid columns, rows, and responsive breakpoints.

5. **Carousel Photo Gallery:**
    - Incorporate a Bootstrap carousel component to showcase images, projects, or any other relevant content.
    - This gallery should be interactive, allowing users to manually cycle through the content or have it play automatically.

6. **Cards:**
    - Use Bootstrap cards to display information or content in a structured format. This could be for showcasing skills, highlighting experiences, or sharing fun facts.

    - Implement at least one modal. This could be used for displaying more detailed content, a contact form, or any other information that you want to present in an interactive overlay format.

8. **Responsiveness:**
    - The design should be fully responsive, meaning it looks and functions well on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
    - Utilize Bootstrap's responsive utilities where needed.
